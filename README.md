# Notes

- Traditional unit testing and developer testing are all about writing tests to verify that the code works as it is supposed to.

- **TDD** does not focus about testing. The simple act of writing a test before the implementation changes the way we think when we implement the corresponding functionality.

- The tests tha are written in TDD are those that drive the development forward, and not necessarily those that cover all imaginable scenarios.
